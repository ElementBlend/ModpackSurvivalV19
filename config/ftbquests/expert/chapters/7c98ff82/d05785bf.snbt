		"Similar to Ender IO's other Simple machines, capacitors cannot be used in the Simple Powered Furnace, so its processing speed cannot be improved.",
		"",
		"The machine constantly leaks 0.1 �I/t (2 �I/s) in addition to its energy usage during processing, and will continue to leak energy while not processing.",

		"Uniquely, the Simple Powered Furnace does not have a direct upgrade. However, the Alloy Smelter can be seen as an upgrade to both the Simple Powered Furnace and the Simple Alloy Smelter, as it combines smelting and alloying functionality."
