		"Used to recharge items which use Micro Infinity (ï¿½I) or other forms of Forge Energy, as well as items which use Redstone Flux.",
		"",
		"Its charging speed depends entirely on the energy storage of the item that is currently being charged. Items with larger energy storage will be charged faster.",
		"",
		"This machine is an upgraded version of the Wired Charger. It offers a much larger internal energy buffer, enabling the player to more easily charge items with very large energy storage.",
		"",
		"Like most Ender IO machines, the Enhanced Wired Charger requires at least a Basic Capacitor to be installed to function. Better capacitors only increase the internal energy buffer."
