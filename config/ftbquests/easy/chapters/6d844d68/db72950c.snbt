		"The Rain Shield blocks rain or snow in a 5 chunk radius. In its radius there will be no rain/snow particles / sounds & stuff like fire that would normally react to rain will act as if it wasnâ€™t raining. By applying a redstone signal to it you can disable its effect. There will also be no snow forming on top of blocks in snowy biomes."
