		"Uses Micro Infinity (ï¿½I) to both smelt items and to create alloys like Dark Steel. The Alloy Smelter has three input slots and one output slot.",
		"",
		"This machine is an upgraded version of the Alloy Smelter, offering increased energy storage and power use, resulting in higher processing speeds. However, it has a downside: being 1.5 blocks high, it requires more vertical space; additionally, pipes and other automation cannot interact with the half block on its top side, making automation more difficult.",
		"",
		"Like most Ender IO machines, the Enhanced Alloy Smelter requires at least a Basic Capacitor to be installed to function. Better capacitors increase the machine's maximum energy usage rate and thus processing speed, as well as the internal energy buffer."
