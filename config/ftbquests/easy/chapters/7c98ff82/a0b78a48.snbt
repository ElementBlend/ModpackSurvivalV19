		"By default, the machine is capable of producing alloys from some other mods as well as Ender IO alloys. Notable is its ability to create Thermal Foundation alloys like Enderium, circumventing the fluid crafting that is normally required to create these alloys.",

		"Like most Ender IO machines, the Alloy Smelter requires at least a Basic Capacitor to be installed to function. Better capacitors increase the machine's maximum energy usage rate and thus processing speed, as well as the internal energy buffer."
